# Evaluation Metrics for Heart Disease Prediction Models

Model: Random Forest (with hyperparameter tuning)

- Accuracy: 0.87
- Precision: 0.85
- Recall: 0.89
- F1-score: 0.87
- ROC AUC: 0.91

Notes:
- These metrics are based on the test dataset split (20% of total data).
- Hyperparameters used: n_estimators=100, max_depth=6, min_samples_split=2
- Model shows good balance between sensitivity and specificity.
